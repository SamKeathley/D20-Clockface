# Fitbit Versa D20 Clockface   

This is a simple custom digital watchface for the Fitbit Versa family. This features a simple D20 background that I made with SVG and only displays the date, time, and battery percentage. All of the art is original.

I build this watchface because I wanted something that was more "me" and I also don't care much about the health statistic aspects of the watch.

### Technologies used
---
- FitBit SDK / Clock API
- Tested functionality with FitBit Studio & virtual OS Simulator
